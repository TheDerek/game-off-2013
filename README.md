Ryan and Derek's attempt at Game Off 2013
=========================================

Slatch - A game about change
----------------------------

Slatch is a creature with the goal of saving the planet from destruction. 
You start the game with all possible abilities as you aim to reach the end of the stage using everything at your disposal.
Each route requires a focus on an individual ability to reach the goal. However, once you arrive at the goal using a certain path, the ability you used to reach that end must be sacrificed.
The level is then restarted with said ability taken away from you, and as such the previously used path will be rendered unusable with the previously used exit being sealed.

Your goal
---------

The aim of the game is to direct our loveable hero, Slatch, to the end of the level using every possible path (and therefore use every possible ability) in the hopes of sealing off and preventing each method of planetary destruction.
